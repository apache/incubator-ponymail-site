# Installing Pony Mail #


If your distro is on this list, please refer to that specific document
for detailed package installation instructions:

- [Debian (Jessie) Installation Instructions](install.debian.html)
- [Ubuntu (14.04) Installation Instructions](install.ubuntu.html)
- [CentOS (7.1) Installation Instructions](install.centos.html)
- [Fedora (22) Installation Instructions](install.fedora.html)

Otherwise, read the next two chapters:

## Pre-requisites ##
You will need the following software installed on your machine:

- ElasticSearch >= 2.1 and < 6.0 (setup.py does not support 6.x+; the code may perhaps run on 6.x)
- Python 3.x for the archiver plugin (setup.py will handle dependencies) and importer
- Python `html2text` package (GPLv3) if you wish to archive HTML-only mails (remember to add the `--html2text` command line arg)
- Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x with mod_lua (see http://modlua.org/gs/installing if you need to build mod_lua manually)
- Lua >=5.1 with the following modules: cjson, luasec, luasocket
  (Note: Lua 5.3 is not currently supported by httpd mod_lua or luasocket)


## Download and Install ##

- Download the git repo: `git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-ponymail.git`
- Start ElasticSearch on the machine it needs to run on.
- Run setup.py in the `tools` dir:
```
      $cd tools
      $python3 setup.py
      ...[follow instructions in the setup script]
```
- Edit `site/js/config.js` to suit your needs (usually very little editing is needed)
- Set up the appropriate authorisation for private lists. For examples, see:
  https://github.com/apache/incubator-ponymail/tree/master/aaa_examples



### Using auth for ElasticSearch ###
If your ElasticSearch instance requires authentication for the importer/archiver, please
add the following lines in the `elasticsearch` block of `ponymail.cfg` once generated:

~~~
user:           [username for ES]
password:       [password for ES]
~~~


### Using Apache HTTP Server: ###
- Set up a VirtualHost block in Apache httpd that points to the `site/` directory in Pony Mail
- Add the configuration snippets from `configs/ponymail_httpd.conf` to the virtual host
- Start Apache httpd to enable the user-facing interface

### Using nginx: ###
- To use nginx, you will also need to install the `lua-apr` module from your distro.
- Set up a Server block in nginx that points to the `site/` directory in Pony Mail
- Add the configuration snippets from `configs/ponymail_nginx.conf` to the server config
- Start nginx to enable the user-facing interface


## Setting up the archiver ##
First off, you will need both `tools/archiver.py` and the generated
`tools/ponymail.cfg` present on the machine that your mail server runs on. This
machine should also have access to the ElasticSearch backend.

If your mailing list supports feeding emails to a program, feed the incoming new
emails to `python3 /path/to/tools/archiver.py` and it will use STDIN as the
transport mechanism. If you are simply using aliases or dot-forwards and no ML
system, you can add (for example) `"|/usr/bin/python3
/path/to/tools/archiver.py"` to your alias file to enable archiving. If you are
not using a Mailing List manager, you will need to tell Pony Mail which email
header determines the list ID using the --altheader argument, for instance:
```
    foolist: "|/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/tools/archiver.py --altheader delivered-to"
    foolist-private: "|/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/tools/archiver.py --altheader delivered-to --private"
```

If you are using MailMan 3, you can add archiver.py as an archive by following the instructions inside the python script:
- Copy the archiver.py file to `$mailman_plugin_dir/mailman_ponymail/__init__.py`
- Copy ponymail.cfg to the same dir (for ES configuration)
- Enable the module by adding the following to your `mailman.cfg` file::
```
  [archiver.ponymail]
  # Pony Mail
  class: mailman_ponymail.Archiver
  enable: yes
```

For older mailing list systems such as Mailman 2 and ezmlm, you can also
take a look at our [archiving examples](archiving.html) page for pointers.

## Public versus private lists ##
In MailMan 3, this should be auto-detected and is not a concern.
When using other ML systems via piping to STDIN, you should add
the --private arg to the python script to mark an email as private:
```
    foolist-private: "|/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/tools/archiver.py --private"
    foolist-public: "|/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/tools/archiver.py"
```
Note that private lists are subject to authorisation which you should set up as noted above

## Importing old data into Pony Mail
See [this guide](importing.html) for details on how to import old archives into Pony Mail.

## Bulk editing lists ##
You can use `edit-list.py` to perform bulk operations:
- Rename lists
- Mark entire lists are private or public

Run `python3 edit-list.py --help` for CLI args.


## Setting up OAuth for Pony Mail ##
If you want people to be able to log in and reply via the Web UI, you
can specify an OAuth provider.


### Setting up an OAuth provider ###
Pony Mail comes with a few default OAuth examples in `site/js/config.js`, such
as ASF Oauth and Google OAuth. You can enable these by uncommenting the lines in
question, or set up your own OAuth portal to handle things. This is a standard
OAuth that expects the backend to supply the following JSON data on success:

~~~
    {
        "fullname": "The full name of the authed user",
        "email": "The user's email address",
        "uid": "(optional) The unique user ID of the logged in user (for instance, LDAP UID)",
        "isMember": true/false (optional, specifies whether the person is a privileged user with access to all lists)
    }
~~~

For private list browsing, Pony Mail supplies an example AAA library in
`site/api/lib/aaa.lua` that does LDAP lookups to determine which groups a person
belongs to, and thus which lists said person has access to. The AAA example is
modelled on the Apache LDAP structure, so you may wish to change this to suit
your need. We have [several simple AAA examples](../aaa_examples/) in the
`aaa_examples` directory.

If you are looking for an OAuth portal to provide users access to private lists
in the archive, you will need to add the OAuth domain to config.admin_oauth in
config.lua:

~~~
    admin_oauth = { 'myoauth.foo.tld', '*.oauthprovider.com', 'etc' }
~~~

If not specified in config.lua, OAuth will only provide users with a place to
store settings and notifications, and - provided your mail server is set to accept
this - a place to reply to emails in the archive.


#### Using GitHub OAuth and other client-secret providers ####
If your OAuth provider requires a client secret, you can specify this in `site/api/lib/config.lua`, as this GitHub example shows:

~~~
    oauth_fields = {
        github = {
            client_secret = "abcdef1",
            client_id = "abcdef2",
            oauth_token = "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"
        }
    }
~~~

This essentially overrides `config.js` but without showing the data to anyone outside the server.

### Whitelisting replies via the Web UI ###
To have Pony Mail accept replies done via the Web UI, you must make sure
that `site/api/lib/config.lua` contains the appropriate string (or array of strings) matching the domain(s) you wish to allow new email for. To allow replies to everything, set this to `* `(NOT RECOMMENDED).
You can also allow based on GLOBs or an array of accepted domains and sub-domains:

~~~
    accepted_domains = "*" -- This would allow posts to any email address, baaaad choice.
    accepted_domains = "foo.org" -- Allow only to *@foo.org
    accepted_domains = "*.foo.org" -- Allow only posts to *@*.foo.org, but not *@foo.org
    accepted_domains = { "foo.org", "*.foo.org" } -- Allow posts both to *.foo.org and foo.org
~~~


### Setting email footers ###
It is possible to set email footers in each email sent via the Web UI.
This is done by configuring the `email_footer` variable in  `site/api/lib/config.lua`.
You may use the following variables in the footer:

~~~
    $list: The mailing list being sent to (foo@bar.tld)
    $hostname: The hostname of the server
    $port: The port of the server (80, 443 etc)
    $msgid: The message ID of the email (for permalinks etc)
~~~

An example footer could be:

~~~
    --------
    Sent via Pony Mail for $list.
    To view this list online, visit: https://my.tld/list.html?$list
    To view this email (and subsequent replies), visit:
    https://my.tld/thread.html/$msgid
    --------
~~~


### A note on email headers ###
By default, headers such as to/cc are not shown in the normal email view.
To enable these headers, set `full_headers` to `true` in the `site/api/lib/config.lua` file.

### Lastly, a note about Message-ID (MID) generators
The default MID generator is called 'medium' and digests the message
body, timestamp and list-ID to generate the MID. There is also a 'short'
that only digests the body, and a 'full' that uses the entire message as
a bytestring to generate an ID. Medium is recommended for most setups
(especially clustered setups), while full can be used for single-machine
setups.
N.B. At present, all the generators have issues, see (#176 #177 #178)
Please see [this paragraph](archiving.html#usingtherightidgenerator) about document ID generators.
